# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched Array lecture on Udemy from The Java Masterclass course by Tim Buchalka and gave a try to the array challenge (I have not solved it yet entirely)

**Thoughts:** : I really struggled with the descend ordering in an array, even so I have done it before (about a year ago). I always have to give it a sleep or some hours to solve these kind of logical problems. I think it will be better over time.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Array challenge (with a little help) and I watched a recap about Arrays in Tim Buchalka's java Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** : I had some hard time figuring out the sorting algorithm as I had t use maximum of 3 methods and one of my previous sorting program sued 5 of them. So I had to get some help fro the Internet but I got the idea of the used algorithm and from this PoV it seems easy and a" Why I did not think of this.." solution. :)

### Day 3: April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the MinValue Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned some useful information about references.

**Thoughts:** : It was a great thing that Tim explained the difference between reference types and value types. Today the challenge went well and I could solve it easily and my mood is still "up".

### Day 4: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the ReverseArray Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned about ArrayLists.

**Thoughts:** : I could solve the reverseArray challenge easily and it got me some confidence. Also I got some refresh about ArrayList. I used them last year in MOOC Java course.

### Day 5: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with Tim's course and learned useful tips about ArrayLists

**Thoughts:** : Today wwas mainly watching some video as I was so tired of getting up early. But my #100DaysofCode cannot suffer this.

### Day 6: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to work on a ArrayList challenge provided by Tim's course.

**Thoughts:** : Today was a bit of struggle as I used the OOP rules a wee bit long time, so I had to cacth it up. (mostly searched the terms in my brain, so it was a bit of a brain-training as well)

### Day 7: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I "finished" the ArrayList Challenge provided by Tim's Java MAsterclass Course. Honestly I do not think I ever feel any of my program finished. Somehow I always find some room for improvement.

**Thoughts:** : Honestly, today I was so tired and I believed it is impossible to code. However I sat down and "coded out of my frustration". I struggled with this challenge a little bit and I do not see it as "finished", but it will do for now(until I refactor the whole thing ^^'). I could not check Tim's solution for this challenge but tomorrow I will see if I was on the righ track.

### Day 8: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I had to put aside Java for a little bit. So I played around CSS shapes and I just started to "draw" something. I will share it once its done!

**Thoughts:** : Today I was tired, so I dropped Java for a day and started to play with CSS shapes.

### Day 9: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed the ArryList Challenge in Tim Buchalka's Javacourse and checked my results with his. Sadly I have to stop the course here, because I started it three times and I still think its a little bit too much and has a little bit less clearer explanations than I expect from a course. So right now I am wondering where to go tomorrow: WebDev/Python another Java course I do not know. 

**Thoughts:** : Most of my thougts written in the progress line.

### Day 10: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued my Java adventure with new MOOC Java programming course. Its very engaging and seems as a good source. 

**Thoughts:** : I set aside Tim's course and continued MOOC Java programming with the renewed course. It feels  alittle bit more engaging and more descriptive.
