# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched Array lecture on Udemy from The Java Masterclass course by Tim Buchalka and gave a try to the array challenge (I have not solved it yet entirely)

**Thoughts:** : I really struggled with the descend ordering in an array, even so I have done it before (about a year ago). I always have to give it a sleep or some hours to solve these kind of logical problems. I think it will be better over time.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Array challenge (with a little help) and I watched a recap about Arrays in Tim Buchalka's java Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** : I had some hard time figuring out the sorting algorithm as I had t use maximum of 3 methods and one of my previous sorting program sued 5 of them. So I had to get some help fro the Internet but I got the idea of the used algorithm and from this PoV it seems easy and a" Why I did not think of this.." solution. :)

### Day 3: April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the MinValue Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned some useful information about references.

**Thoughts:** : It was a great thing that Tim explained the difference between reference types and value types. Today the challenge went well and I could solve it easily and my mood is still "up".

### Day 4: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the ReverseArray Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned about ArrayLists.

**Thoughts:** : I could solve the reverseArray challenge easily and it got me some confidence. Also I got some refresh about ArrayList. I used them last year in MOOC Java course.

### Day 5: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with Tim's course and learned useful tips about ArrayLists

**Thoughts:** : Today wwas mainly watching some video as I was so tired of getting up early. But my #100DaysofCode cannot suffer this.

### Day 6: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to work on a ArrayList challenge provided by Tim's course.

**Thoughts:** : Today was a bit of struggle as I used the OOP rules a wee bit long time, so I had to cacth it up. (mostly searched the terms in my brain, so it was a bit of a brain-training as well)

### Day 7: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I "finished" the ArrayList Challenge provided by Tim's Java MAsterclass Course. Honestly I do not think I ever feel any of my program finished. Somehow I always find some room for improvement.

**Thoughts:** : Honestly, today I was so tired and I believed it is impossible to code. However I sat down and "coded out of my frustration". I struggled with this challenge a little bit and I do not see it as "finished", but it will do for now(until I refactor the whole thing ^^'). I could not check Tim's solution for this challenge but tomorrow I will see if I was on the righ track.

### Day 8: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I had to put aside Java for a little bit. So I played around CSS shapes and I just started to "draw" something. I will share it once its done!

**Thoughts:** : Today I was tired, so I dropped Java for a day and started to play with CSS shapes.

### Day 9: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed the ArryList Challenge in Tim Buchalka's Javacourse and checked my results with his. Sadly I have to stop the course here, because I started it three times and I still think its a little bit too much and has a little bit less clearer explanations than I expect from a course. So right now I am wondering where to go tomorrow: WebDev/Python another Java course I do not know. 

**Thoughts:** : Most of my thougts written in the progress line.

### Day 10: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued my Java adventure with new MOOC Java programming course. Its very engaging and seems as a good source. 

**Thoughts:** : I set aside Tim's course and continued MOOC Java programming with the renewed course. It feels  alittle bit more engaging and more descriptive.

### Day 11: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with new MOOC Java programming course. I was a little bit tired but somehow  could manage to code today as well.

**Thoughts:** : I was so tired after work, I did not expect that I could code after it. But I pushed myself a littlebit and finished some excercises in MOOC Java.

### Day 12: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the MOOC Java course. I like the style of the course! Also I started to search after some projects where I could use my Java knowledge. No luck yet, but I might need another approach to find some ideas..

**Thoughts:** : I coded before noon, so I could do it with a fresh mind, which was quite useful.

### Day 13: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I set aside Java for a little bit and continued CS50. I submitted the Scratch Problem set. I did not know about Scratch before, it was a real surprise. After that I continued with the C lecture.

**Thoughts:** : The CS50 teacher is amazing and the course is absolutely engaging and worthwhile. I am so surprised how much I did not know about computers! (even so I am an Engineer)

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 14: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: As I had to skip a day, I doubled the time I spent with programming. I contineud and finished the C lecture of CS50 and submitted the frist assignment. One more to go.

**Thoughts:** : Yesterday was busy so I could not code. However today I spent 2 hours+ with coding so all debts are paid.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 15: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent my hours to finish the second task of the C part of CS50: Intro. It is still incomplete but I am close to finish it.

**Thoughts:** : I got stuck with the second C submission, which made me a little bit tired. So I continue tomorrow from here. I am close to the solution!

### Day 16: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I had very little time, so I polished my submission for CS50 and its almost ready.

**Thoughts:** : Today I only coded at the morning but it was more effective then last night. I think my brain has more power in morning.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 17: May 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent 4 hours with CS50: Intro to CS. I submitted the credit card number validitiy checker submission and continued to the Array section of the course. I like this course, now I know why others recommend it.

**Thoughts:** : I spent four hours with coding today and I am very proud of that!

### Day 18: May 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued Cs50 Array lecture and finished with the short videos too. I started to plan my solution for the first pset in this lecture.  

**Thoughts:** : I was a little bi tired , so today I just watched the left short videos and started to plan how to solve the first pset. Tomorrow I'll try to crack it! 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 19: May 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished and submitted the "readability" problem set for CS50. I learned a lot during the creation of the program. Last but not least I enjoyed creating this program!

**Thoughts:** : First in my life I enjoyed creating the solution for this problem set. I dont know why but it seems I start to think better of myself! I learned to respect myself and to be patient with my progress. I imagine that one day I will not be as hard on myself as in the past, since I start to understand that I hurt myself a lot and it was neither good nor wise.

### Day 20: May 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Caesar problem set for CS50 and it seems easy but it contains some tricky part. But I am tired of work so I have to finish it tomorrow morning (before work). 

**Thoughts:** : I was a little bit tired so I coded only 1 hour so I could not finisht he problem set. But I am proud that I am not struggling that much on an erro and I ama ble to resolve it quickly! Progress..progress!

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 21: May 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the Caesar problem set but I could not finish it since I had a very little time to code today. But tomorrow I will finish it!

**Thoughts:** : Just a thought: One must be patient to her/himself and not to forget kindness. Those two will bring you great and bright moments.

### Day 22: May 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Caesar pset for CS50 and I am kind of proud of it. However I have to refactor my code as I suspect some places where I could use a smarter approach. But its working. 
Next up is the Substitution pset  which is a little bit harder.

**Thoughts:** : I am proud of creating this program, and I can not wait to start the other pset which is more complex than this one!

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 23: May 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I refactored my code for the Caesar pset and its better now. After that I started to work on the substitution pset. 

**Thoughts:** : I am starting to realize that I kind of enjoy the coding process and sometimes during work I do some "sneaky coding" instead of my job. Maybe it seems bad but its exactly the opposite. Finally I can do what I want instead of doing something for someone who does not value it too much. I am doing things for myself as I value my work! 

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 24: May 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have successfully submitted the Substitution problem set for CS50x. I could create it faster than the Caesar project. So I am a little bit proud of myself!

**Thoughts:** : It was so good that I coudl solve this problem easier than the one before. I feel proud and I am happy about this!

### Day 25: May 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**:Continued Cs50 with the algortihm section and it was really intriguing and in some spot confusing. Lets see tomorrow how well I understood the basics of recursion and some of the sort algorithm like merge sort.

**Thoughts:** : Since I had a headache I only watched some videos today, but it was enough to push my brain to think hardly. I think its good and thats what my brain needs, some material to think of. NOw I close my day with "Antonius and Cleopatra" on National Theatre Live Youtube channel.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 26: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had the chance to try out recursion and its quite useful I must say! LAso continued with the short videos on CS50 and tomorrow I start to solve the problemset(s) for Week3. 

**Thoughts:** : Today I had to reinstall Windows, as I faced the issue that I need some gaming to chill from programming and work. Now, I need to control my behaviour accordingly!

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 27: May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I successfully submitted the plurality porblem set for CS50. I will start the next problem set tomorrow, as today my brain needs some rest so I obey it.

**Thoughts:** : Lets face it, I solved the problem set but the rancher config at work made me tired. So it is a great accomplishment for today!

### Day 28: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have finished with the rundown challenge for CS50 and it has passed all the tests! Tomorrow I try to solve the Tideman challenge. Let see how far I get...

**Thoughts:** : Today after work I was tired again, so my brain was slow a little bit. However I could solve the runoff challenge and I am proud that I could do it with one blow (no errors for the first run). Of course it might has some room for improvement, but I will get back to it later. (when I have more experience)

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 29: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the Tideman problem set, but I stuck on one of the functions. I decided to put it away a little bit and get back to it tomorrow with a fresh brain. But at least I solved two of the required functions, so this day will not go in vain.

**Thoughts:** : Today I struggled a little bit and I had to decide to put away the problem set and let my brain rest. It seems my hours in work started to be a little bit more challenging, so some of my energy gone there.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 30: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I tried to crack the tideman challenge, but no luck so far. I think I will have more luck tomorrow since there will be no  work houra after &before coding :)

**Thoughts:** : I do not have the mood to share my thoughts.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 31: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I could finally create two of the functions I struggled with earlier for the Tideman challenge, 2 more to go and I am done with it. Somehow this problem set seems harder than the ones before...

**Thoughts:** : I do not have the mood to share my thoughts.

### Day 32: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to understand recursion and practiced it a little bit. I would not say that I am completely  comfortable to use it but I could create some basic "logic" using it.

**Thoughts:** : I was not continued my studies with the enxt week as I tried to understand recursion. I could create some functions with it and a bug of course :).

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 33: May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had very little time today (1 hour) to code and I practiced recursion a little bit more. 

**Thoughts:** : Nothing special, just a little coding at morning.
