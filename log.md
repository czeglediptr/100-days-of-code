# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched Array lecture on Udemy from The Java Masterclass course by Tim Buchalka and gave a try to the array challenge (I have not solved it yet entirely)

**Thoughts:** : I really struggled with the descend ordering in an array, even so I have done it before (about a year ago). I always have to give it a sleep or some hours to solve these kind of logical problems. I think it will be better over time.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Array challenge (with a little help) and I watched a recap about Arrays in Tim Buchalka's java Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** : I had some hard time figuring out the sorting algorithm as I had t use maximum of 3 methods and one of my previous sorting program sued 5 of them. So I had to get some help fro the Internet but I got the idea of the used algorithm and from this PoV it seems easy and a" Why I did not think of this.." solution. :)

### Day 3: April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the MinValue Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned some useful information about references.

**Thoughts:** : It was a great thing that Tim explained the difference between reference types and value types. Today the challenge went well and I could solve it easily and my mood is still "up".

### Day 4: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the ReverseArray Challenge in Tim's Java Masterclass and learned about ArrayLists.

**Thoughts:** : I could solve the reverseArray challenge easily and it got me some confidence. Also I got some refresh about ArrayList. I used them last year in MOOC Java course.

### Day 5: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with Tim's course and learned useful tips about ArrayLists

**Thoughts:** : Today wwas mainly watching some video as I was so tired of getting up early. But my #100DaysofCode cannot suffer this.

### Day 6: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to work on a ArrayList challenge provided by Tim's course.

**Thoughts:** : Today was a bit of struggle as I used the OOP rules a wee bit long time, so I had to cacth it up. (mostly searched the terms in my brain, so it was a bit of a brain-training as well)
