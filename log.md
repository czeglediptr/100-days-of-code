# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched Array lecture on Udemy from The Java Masterclass course by Tim Buchalka and gave a try to the array challenge (I have not solved it yet entirely)

**Thoughts:** : I really struggled with the descend ordering in an array, even so I have done it before (about a year ago). I always have to give it a sleep or some hours to solve these kind of logical problems. I think it will be better over time.

### Day 2: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Array challenge (with a little help) and I watched a recap about Arrays in Tim Buchalka's java Masterclass.

**Thoughts:** : I had some hard time figuring out the sorting algorithm as I had t use maximum of 3 methods and one of my previous sorting program sued 5 of them. So I had to get some help fro the Internet but I got the idea of the used algorithm and from this PoV it seems easy and a" Why I did not think of this.." solution. :)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
